component can use it.\n   To keep the rendering process fast, use-style works asynchronously, meaning that it\n   does not add the generated CSS class into the DOM immediately, but very soon instead.\n   If the style has not been added into the DOM yet, it returns the given props as inline style,\n   so that the component looks good even if CSS class has not been generated yet.\n\n   Important exception: if the style contains specific modes or media query definitions,\n   which cannot be used as inline style, {:style {:visibility \\\"hidden\\\"}} is returned.\n   Thus, the component is going to be hidden for a few milliseconds.\n   In most cases, this is not a problem, but if you want to avoid it, see prepare-styles function.\n\n   The given 'style' parameter is a map which contains CSS style properties\n   (as supported by Garden library). There can also be special namespaced keywords\n   along with the style definitions. These are:\n\n   Core features:\n\n   ::sub-styles        Makes it possible to define a named style map inside of the main style map.\n                       The contents of ::sub-styles should be a map, in which keys define the name of\n                       the sub-style and values contain the style properties.\n                       Sub-styles are nothing special, they are supposed to contain the same contents\n                       as the main style map. ::sub-styles helps you to define styles that are closely\n                       related to the main style map but do not deserve their own 'def'.\n   ::mode              A map in which keys are mode names and values are style properties.\n                       Internally all modes are converted to CSS pseudoclasses or pseudoelements.\n                       You can use any mode name that is a valid CSS speudoclass.\n   ::media             A map in which keys are maps presenting CSS media query definitions, and values\n                       are style maps which are used when the media query is active.\n                       Vendor prefixes and modes can be used inside the media query style map.\n   ::supports          A map in which keys are strings presenting CSS feature query definitions, and values\n                       are style maps which are used when the supports query is active.\n                       Vendor prefixes, media queries and modes can be used inside the support query style map.\n   ::vendors           A vector of vendor prefixes that are used with ::auto-prefix.\n   ::auto-prefix       A set of style properties that should be prefixed with ::vendors.\n   ::with-classes      A collection of additional class names that should always be used with\n                       this style definition.\n\n   Additional features:\n\n   ::class-prefix      Custom prefix for generated class names. If not given, the default prefix will be used.\n                       Custom prefix can be used for debugging and automatic software testing purposes.\n                       Note that you need to set custom class prefixes on in the init function.\n   ::manual            Manual mode can be used to style child elements with manually written CSS selectors\n                       using Garden syntax. It should be used only for styling 3rd party components and\n                       resolving corner cases in which complex CSS selectors are needed.\n                       For the most part, it is recommended to use ::sub-styles.\n\n   Options is an optional map, which contains HTML attributes (:class, :href, :src etc.).\n   It can also contain the following special keywords features:\n\n   ::with-classes       DEPRECATED. A vector of additional class names used with the current style.\n                        Deprecated since version 1.3.0: The options map can now contain\n                        any HTML attributes.
